      "guidance": "Insider risk management must span the entire employee lifecycle. Pre-hire: background checks, reference verification, screening for risk factors. Onboarding: security awareness, policy acknowledgment, least privilege. Ongoing: periodic access reviews, behavioral analytics, manager training. Transitions: role changes trigger access re-certification. Departures: exit interviews exploring risk factors, coordinated off-boarding (HR-IT-Security), enhanced monitoring during notice period. CISA Insider Threat Mitigation Guide emphasizes that 85% of insider incidents occur during transitions (role changes, performance issues, departures). Layoffs/redundancies require coordinated protocols.",
