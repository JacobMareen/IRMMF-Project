# Multi-Select Questions - User Guide

## What Are Multi-Select Questions?

Multi-select questions allow you to select **multiple answer options** instead of just one. These questions are used to assess the comprehensiveness of your organization's capabilities across a specific area.

## How to Identify Multi-Select Questions

When you encounter a multi-select question, you'll see:

1. **Blue Information Banner:** "Select all that apply (multiple selections allowed)"
2. **Checkboxes:** Instead of single-choice buttons, you'll see checkboxes next to each option
3. **"Confirm Selection" Button:** A prominent button at the bottom to submit your choices

## How to Answer Multi-Select Questions

### Step 1: Review the Question
Read the question text and guidance carefully. Multi-select questions typically ask about:
- Which capabilities you have in place
- Which channels or methods you use
- Which frameworks or regulations you address
- Which user populations you monitor

### Step 2: Select All Applicable Options
- **Click on checkboxes** to select options that apply to your organization
- You can select **as many options as needed** (no limit)
- Selected options will have a gold-tinted background
- Click again to deselect if you change your mind

### Step 3: Confirm Your Selection
- Once you've selected all applicable options, click **"Confirm Selection"**
- The button is disabled until you select at least one option
- After confirming, the assessment will auto-advance to the next question (if enabled)

## Scoring System

Multi-select questions use a **maturity-based scoring system** that reflects the comprehensiveness of your controls:

| Selections | Score | Maturity Level | Description |
|-----------|-------|----------------|-------------|
| **0** | 0 | None | No capabilities in place |
| **1-2** | 1 | Ad hoc | Ad hoc implementation with significant gaps |
| **3-4** | 2 | Developing | Developing program with basic coverage |
| **5-6** | 3 | Established | Established program with comprehensive coverage |
| **7+** | 4 | Mature | Mature program with industry-leading coverage |

### Why This Scoring System?

The scoring reflects that:
- **More comprehensive controls = higher maturity**
- Organizations with multiple overlapping detection methods are more resilient
- Mature programs have redundancy and defense-in-depth

This is different from traditional "pick one" questions where each option has a fixed score.

## Examples of Multi-Select Questions

### Example 1: Fraud Detection Capabilities
**Question:** "Which fraud detection capabilities does your organization currently employ? (Select all that apply)"

**Options:**
- Behavioral analytics
- Transaction monitoring
- Data analytics
- Periodic audits
- Anonymous tips hotline
- Manager escalations
- Automated alerts

**If you select 5 options:** Your score would be 3 (Established program with comprehensive coverage)

### Example 2: Whistleblower Reporting Channels
**Question:** "Which whistleblower reporting channels does your organization provide? (Select all that apply)"

**Options:**
- Anonymous hotline
- Web portal
- Email
- In-person reporting
- Third-party service
- Mobile app

**If you select 2 options:** Your score would be 1 (Ad hoc implementation - consider adding more channels)

## Tips for Accurate Assessment

1. **Select ALL that apply:** Don't be conservative. If you have the capability, select it.
2. **Consider actual usage:** Only select options for capabilities that are actually implemented and used (not just planned)
3. **Organization-wide scope:** Consider capabilities across your entire organization, not just one department
4. **Recent implementations:** Include capabilities implemented within the last 12 months

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I change my selections?
**A:** Yes! Before clicking "Confirm Selection", you can click checkboxes to toggle selections on and off.

### Q: What if I accidentally skip a multi-select question?
**A:** You can use the sidebar to navigate back to any question. Your selections are preserved after you confirm them.

### Q: Can I defer a multi-select question?
**A:** Yes! Use the "Defer / Skip" button if you need to research your answer. Your current selections (if any) will be saved.

### Q: Should I select all options to get the highest score?
**A:** No! Only select options that genuinely apply to your organization. The assessment is designed to identify genuine gaps and provide relevant recommendations. Inflating your score will result in inaccurate analysis and unhelpful recommendations.

### Q: What if none of the options apply?
**A:** If you truly have no capabilities in that area, you can click "Confirm Selection" without selecting any options. You'll receive a score of 0, and the system will generate appropriate recommendations to help you build these capabilities.
