Executive summary
IRMMF is a proprietary methodology and assessment platform for Insider Risk and Threat Management (IRTM). It combines governance, legal, human, technical, and operational signals into a single coherent maturity model and produces C-level outputs that translate assessment results into a pragmatic multi-year IRTM program.
What IRMMF is
IRMMF is not a “survey.” It is an adaptive, evidence-aware assessment system designed to:
Route each organization through an appropriate depth of assessment (light to deep) using intake-driven logic.
Ask only questions that are relevant and reachable based on gatekeeper outcomes and maturity signals.
Score across two dimensions simultaneously: (1) framework domains and (2) cross-cutting axes of control quality.
Generate an archetype-based narrative and prioritized program roadmap suitable for executive decision-making.
Target audience & use contexts
Primary users are CISOs and internal audit leads. Secondary stakeholders include HR, legal/privacy, IT operations, risk management, and executive leadership. IRMMF supports onboarding, periodic audits, targeted investigations, and self-assessments. The platform is designed so different roles can contribute without forcing disclosure of sensitive artifacts.
The IRMMF framework
IRMMF defines insider risk maturity across 9 domains and measures quality through 9 cross-cutting axes. Domains describe “what” capabilities exist. Axes describe “how well” they work in practice (governance strength, execution consistency, legal defensibility, friction management, and so on).
Domains (capability areas)
Domain
Purpose (one-line)
1. Strategy & Governance

2. Threat Model & Operations

3. Risk Management

4. Legal, Privacy & Ethics
Lawful basis, proportionality, transparency, and defensibility.
5. Human-Centric Culture
Speak-up, fairness, training, and behavioral norms shaping insider risk.
6. Technical Controls
Identity, data, endpoint, network, and tooling controls for insider pathways.
7. Behavioral Analytics & Detection

8. Investigation & Response

9. Performance & Resilience
Metrics, assurance, exercises, learning, and sustained effectiveness.

Methodology
1) Intake (privacy-first)
IRMMF starts with a short intake that captures the minimum necessary context for routing, benchmarking, and interpretation without collecting company names. The intake uses categories (e.g., sector band, headcount band, data sensitivity band, regulatory exposure band). The user can add identifying details only later, at report export.
2) Depth routing with override (alpha)
A routing engine maps intake to an initial assessment depth (Light, Standard, Deep). In alpha, a “go deeper anyway” toggle is available for power users to override the recommended depth. Depth influences which question tiers are eligible to be asked, not the scoring model itself.
3) Adaptive questioning and reachable paths
IRMMF uses gatekeeper questions (BranchType = Gatekeeper) to unlock or suppress downstream questions. This prevents low-maturity organizations from being overwhelmed while still allowing “shadow maturity” to surface through optional deepening prompts and targeted probes.
Dynamic sidebar: show only reachable questions; hide locked questions until unlocked.
“Parking lot” view: allow users to bookmark questions for later without losing context.
Stop-and-resume: if a user exits, provide a next-best-question suggestion based on the current reachable frontier.
4) Evidence without file uploads
To avoid NDA friction and non-response, IRMMF does not require artifact uploads during assessment. Instead, each relevant question can trigger evidence micro-questions that validate the maturity and complexity of the claimed control. These micro-questions are tailored per question (based on its EvidencePolicyID) and adjust confidence in the score, not only the score itself.
EvidencePolicyID types currently defined in the bank:
EvidencePolicyID
Intent
GOV_STD
Governance standard — Prefer artifact evidence for BaseScore≥3; recency class: governance.
RISK_STD
Risk/targeting standard — Prefer evidence for BaseScore≥3; sample outputs encouraged.
OPS_STD
Operational standard — Operational examples acceptable for BaseScore 2–3; evidence for 4.
CULT_SOFT
Culture soft — Self-report acceptable up to 3; evidence strengthens CI, not required for 3.
LEG_STRICT
Legal strict — Tier A cap low; BaseScore≥3 expects at least artifacts; 4 expects proof/audit.
HUMAN_BIO
Human (Bio-Social) — For Verified score 4: requires Tier C BIO_TELEM evidence + documented intervention protocol ('fitness for duty'). Up to 3 may use artifacts/self-report with reduced CI.
FRICTION_AI
Friction/AI Arbitrage — To score above 3, require evidence of shadow AI/bypass tracking (CASB, proxy logs, egress controls) and an approved AI pathway.
TECH_STRICT
Technical strict — High scores require operational proof: logging integrity, retention, and tested detection/response automation; artifacts alone cap at 3.5.
5) Scoring and structural integrity
IRMMF computes results across domains and axes. Each question contributes to one or two axes (Axis1/Axis2) with weights (W1/W2), and also maps to a domain/function/sub-capability. Questions include criticality (CW) and a threshold (TH) to support structural integrity rules.
Structural Integrity Floor (alpha penalty): for foundational questions (e.g., CW > 1.2) that are failed (answer score < TH), IRMMF applies a multiplicative floor penalty (e.g., 0.3) to prevent “paper maturity” where policies exist but operational reality is weak.
6) Archetypes and recommendation bank
IRMMF translates the numerical profile into a single primary archetype, supported by a recommendation bank that selects prioritized actions based on weak axes, weak domains, and integrity penalties. The system is designed so new archetypes and recommendations can be added without changing scoring formulas.
7) Benchmarking (internal + external)
Benchmarking starts with internal datasets. The design supports later external benchmarking via privacy-preserving peer-group definitions (e.g., sector band + region band + size band), using only aggregated statistics.
Platform outputs
IRMMF produces (1) an executive report with narrative and program plan, (2) a role-based dashboard (CISO, audit, HR), (3) a domain-by-domain matrix view for fast review, and (4) an export package for advisory delivery.
Architecture principles (business-proofing)
Modular engines: intake routing, adaptive pathing, scoring, archetypes, and reporting are separate services/modules.
Versioned question banks and immutable assessment snapshots for audit defensibility.
Privacy-first data minimization: anonymous assessments by default, with opt-in identification at export.
Connector roadmap: metadata-only integrations (counts, timestamps) before any content-level collection.
